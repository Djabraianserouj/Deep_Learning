# Deep_Learning
This repository contains different methods and algorithms used in deep learning ranging from basic Fully Connected Layers to Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) 
and Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN). These methods are implemented using basic python deep learning libraries such as the famous Numpy, etc...
A deep learning model is also implemented using the Pytorch library which has shown a mena F1 score of 0.76 trained and tested on images of broken and shattered solar panels.
